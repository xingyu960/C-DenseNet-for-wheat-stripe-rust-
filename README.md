## How2train
### Create an environment
    *conda create -n pytorch python=3.6
    *conda install pytorch==1.2.0 torchvision==0.4.0 cudatoolkit=10.0
    *pip install -r requirements.txt
### train
    *Before training, you need to change all the file paths in train.py and dataset_nocsv.py to your path
    *The labels in dataset_nocsv.py need to be replaced with the label name of your training set
    *python train.py 
### test
    *Before testing, you need to change all the file paths in test.py and dataset_nocsv.py to your path
    *The class_names in test.py need to be consistent with the class name order during training
    *python test.py
